# Structure of Project

## Components

These are components that can be reused throughout the project. If you feel like your component can be reused on multiple screens place them there. 

## Screens

The screen components always live in the **Screen** folder. Inside a Screen component you will find

- `index.js` where the screen component itself lives
- various other components related to the screen component

## Library components

We use components from nativebase.io. check out their documentation.
